### Usage Tips

- If you know the bookID of a manga you want to search for, you can search for it directly by typing
  `book/<bookID>` in the search bar in the Tachiyomi app, this works for `read/<bookID>` too, with
  or without `http(s)://projectsuki.com`
  (you can copy the link of a book or chapter into the search bar).
- Inside the extension settings (Extensions > ProjectSuki > Gear icon right of "Multi") you can
  whitelist and blacklist languages, instructions are provided there.
  There you can also provide a custom
  [User-Agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent) if necessary.
