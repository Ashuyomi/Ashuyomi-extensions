## FAQ

### Why chapters are missing in some titles?

MANGA Plus does not host all chapters due to their licensing politics. The website
is designed to let the users read the weekly/monthly official simulreleases. If you want
to read old chapters of a series that does not have the complete list, you need to find
another sources.

### Why disabling split pages setting does not work?

The MANGA Plus API does not have the support to disabling the dual page split in
all chapters, besides the extension parsing the correct parameter value in the requests.
This is something that unfortunately can't be fixed on the extension side yet.
